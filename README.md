# Slime Stomper
BL-MSCH-C220-10088, October 14th, 2023
A 2D Platformer game.

## Implementation

Player character can move left and right using A and D respectively. Space allows the player to jump from platform to platform. Jumping on top of one of the handful of slimes scattered throughout the two levels will add to the slime counter above the player's head. Red slimes are the slowest, green slimes are moderate in speed, and blue slimes are the fastest. 

The game was created in Godot 4. All visual assets are open source or from the course material, music and sound created by me in Ableton Live 11 Standard.

## What Makes this a Game?

The player has the will and ability to play as many times as they'd like to rack up as many points as they choose.
